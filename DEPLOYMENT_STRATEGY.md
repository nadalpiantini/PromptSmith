## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Database Migration
**Risk**: Schema migration could fail or corrupt data
**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Complete database backup before migration
- Test migration script in staging multiple times
- Have rollback SQL script ready
- Monitor migration progress in real-time

#### 2. Environment Configuration
**Risk**: Missing or incorrect environment variables
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Use production readiness check script
- Validate all environment variables before deployment
- Have configuration checklist
- Test in staging environment first

#### 3. Type System Mismatch
**Risk**: TypeScript types don't match database schema
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Update Supabase types after migration
- Run type checking before deployment
- Have type generation scripts ready
- Test with actual database data

### Rollback Procedures

#### Database Rollback
```sql
-- Emergency rollback script
-- Remove new domain values if necessary
-- Only if no data uses new domains
ALTER TYPE promptsmith_domain RENAME TO promptsmith_domain_old;
CREATE TYPE promptsmith_domain AS ENUM ('sql', 'branding', 'cine', 'saas', 'devops', 'general');
-- Update tables to use new type
-- This is complex - prefer forward fixes
```

#### Application Rollback
```bash
# Git-based rollback
git revert HEAD  # Revert latest commit
npm run build
# Redeploy previous version

# Or tag-based rollback
git checkout v0.9.9  # Previous stable version
npm run build
# Deploy previous version
```

#### Environment Rollback
- Restore previous environment variable configurations
- Revert to previous database connection settings
- Restore previous monitoring configurations
